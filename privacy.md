### Introduction  
This privacy policy applies to the **Peak Watts** app and explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our app.

If you choose to use our Service you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. Collected information is used for providing and improving the Service.

### 1. Information Collection and Use  

### a) User Profile and Device Info
For better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to:
* Birth year
* Weight

The information that we request will be stored on your device exclusively and be used to provide you with more accurate metrics.  

For Service operation and troubleshooting purpose we might automatically collect information on your device, including but not limited to:
* Manufacturer and model
* OS version
* Display resolution
* App version

For subscription processing purpose your device will be assigned with a random anonymous ID. This ID is used to determine subscription status and provide you with additional features in case subscription is active.

### b) In-ride Data Collection
In order to provide the Service app needs access to your current location as well as other cycling-related data which can be obtained from the device or external sensors.

The following list describes which data we might access and record:

* **Location data**
  - GPS data is accessed during the ride to keep track of your location (longitude, latitude), altitude and speed. The first time you start a ride we will request your permission to access your location.
  - You can choose to revoke location access by disabling "Location Access" in the activity profile (indoor profile is an example of such configuration).
  - Apart from access during the ride, app might access your location while you are navigating the app interface to provide services like weather forecast for your location. 

* **External sensors**
  - Data collected from connected Bluetooth sensors might include your speed, cadence, heart rate, power or radar data. This data is displayed to you during the ride and recorded for post-ride analysis.
  - App will connect to sensor only if you choose to pair that sensor. 
  - You can disconnect or unpair sensors at any time from the "Sensors" view.

* **Device sensors**
  - App might use device barometer data, if your device is equipped with it, for elevation calculation. App will monitor your device's battery state during the ride to provide battery life information. The default app configuration allows the use of both sensors. 
  - You can revoke access to these sensors by unpairing them from the "Sensors" view at any time.

Data collection and recording will happen even if the app is in the background. Recorded data is stored exclusively on your device. 

### c) Analytics Data
We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect app usage data and crash reports.
We use this data to understand and analyze app usage trends and to operate, maintain and develop our Services. 

We also use Mapbox as map service provider. Mapbox uses telemetry service which collects de-identified and aggregated user location data to improve Map data and services.

You can enable or disable this data collection at any time in the application settings view.
